# Personality vs. Risk of Drug Use

This repository contains a machine learning project as part of the data science bootcamp by neuefische. We used different supervised machine learning models to predict the risk of drug abuse based on demographic information and personality traits. A good summary of the insights we gained and the best models we performed is given in the slides found in "Drug_Consumption_Slides.pdf". More information about the structure of the repository and the dataset is given below.

The objective of this project was to predict drug consumption habbits given certain personality traits. This kind of risk assesment is of high interest for health insurance companies, as drug addictions usually lead to high treatment costs in the long run. Furthermore this kind of evaluations can help to take better individual preventive measures.

## Structure of the Repository

- **data**: raw and processed data in corresponding sub-folders.
- **notebooks**: python jupyter notebooks for data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modelling of the data, stored in corresponding sub-folders.
- **datase_infos.md**: information on the dataset taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- **Drug_Consumption_Slides.pdf**: slides from the 10-minute presentation we had to give at the end of the one-week project.

## Information on the Drug Consumption Dataset
The data is taken from an online servey on the drug usage of 18 different legal and illegal drugs. The dataset also contains information about the participants demographic background (sex, age, education, country), as well as scores for their personality traits (Big Five personality traits (NEO-FFI-R), impulsivity (BIS-11), sensationseeking (ImpSS)). See "dataset_infos_md" for a list of all features and drugs found in the dataset.
